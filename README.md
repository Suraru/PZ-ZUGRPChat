# PZ-roleplaychat
This is a fork off of PZRP's fork off of Buffy's RP Chat. It includes all languages from the most recent version of PZRP's fork, as well as fixes, QOL, and additional commands seen below.

This adds:
+Added /my for /me actions that include 's at the end of your name. For example "/my hand hurts" = "Sura's hand hurts."
+Added aliases for /looc, including /b /ooc (moved from /all)
+Added a function that reads commands case-insensitive, allow you to type /YELL or /Looc
-Removed surrender from ASL signs for compatibility with prisoner mod
-Removed ability to clean self via character customization wheel
-Moved /s alias from /say to /shout

Known Bugs:
-typing /ooc begins each line with C. Example, /ooc test = ((C test))
